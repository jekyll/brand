## SVG Source File

The SVG contains two layers, one version light text suitable for dark backgrounds,
as it appears on the Jekyll website, and another version with dark text suitable
for light backgrounds (other places it’s likely to appear.

## PNG Images

I’ve also included images which can be used directly without having to much about
with exporting them from the SVG every time. There’s two PNGs for each version (dark/light)
one image with a solid background, and one with a transparent background.
