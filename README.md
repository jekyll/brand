## SVG Source Files

#### Original

The SVG contains two layers, one version with light text suitable for dark backgrounds,
as it appears on the Jekyll website, and another version with dark text suitable
for light backgrounds (other places it’s likely to appear).

#### Black & White

A separate SVG contains a solid black version suitable for certain design or print applications. A variation with red liquid is provided as a separate layer.

## PNG Images

I’ve also included images which can be used directly without having to muck about
with exporting them from the SVG every time. There are two PNGs for each version (dark/light),
one image with a solid background, and one with a transparent background.
